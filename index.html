        <h2 class="display-5 text-margin subsection">Purpose:</h2>
        <p class="text-margin"> 
          Many people spend a lot of the day sitting, such as students sitting 
          and studying for hours, and people working at a desk job sitting for 
          most of the day. This can lead to a decrease in overall health and 
          well-being. Desk Health was created to help encourage people such as
          these, to follow some healthy habits that can help combat the 
          negative effects of spending too much time sitting.
        </p>
        <p class="text-margin">
          Desk Health is designed to help many aspects of health and well-being
          such as cardiovascular fitness, muscular fitness, eye health, and 
          mental well-being.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-5 text-margin subsection">
          How this App Can Help You:
        </h2>
        <p class="text-margin">
          This app can help provide reminders and motivation to keep feeling 
          your best while still doing your work! Desk Health can help remind 
          you to rotate between sitting and standing every 30 minutes to 
          decrease the amount of time you spend sitting, and it can help remind
          you to follow the 20-20-20 rule for eye health (every 20 minutes look
          at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds). It can also remind you to 
          take a break from work every now and then for mental well being, if 
          you so chose. Feel free to change time intervals for standing, 
          sitting looking at something farther away, or anything else with 
          timers you can customize, create, and delete!
        </p>
        <p class="text-margin">
          You can alsoset long-term and/or short-term goals and track your 
          progress with Desk Health. Along with tracking goals, you can log 
          workouts and track exercise progress. Want to lose weight or gain 
          weight? Want to get better at drinking water? Desk Health can help 
          motivate you!
        </p>
        <p class="text-margin">Desk health is meant to help motivate you to 
          stay healthy both at and away from the desk to keep up with overall 
          health and well-being!
        </p>

          Work Mode Can Help You Stand More to Be Healthier
        </h2>
        <p class="text-margin">
          Many people spend a lot of the day sitting, such as students sitting 
          and studying for hours, and people working at a desk job sitting for
          most of the day. This can lead to a decrease in overall health and 
          well-being. Desk Health was created to help encourage people such as 
          these, to follow some healthy habits that can help combat the 
          negative effects of spending too much time sitting.
        </p>
        <p class="text-margin">
          These negative factors associated with sedentary time are greater 
          risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, 
          and Type 2 diabetes millitus (T2DM) in adults. However, studies show
          that alternating between sitting and standing can lead to reduced 
          daily sedentary time, improved lower extremity vascular function, and
          improved markers of cardiometabolic health (Bodker et al., 2021). <b>
          It has been found that standing for at least 30 minutes every hour 
          (no more than 45 minutes) can lead to health benefits of being less
          sedentary (Callaghan et al., 2015). The Work Mode feature on Desk 
          Health can help remind and motivate you to follow these 
          recommendations, rotating between sitting and standing!</b>
        </p>
        <h2 class="display-5 text-margin subsection">
          Exercise Mode Can Help You Get the Exercise You Need
        </h2>
        <p class="text-margin">
          Reducing time sitting everyday is great for health, but it is no 
          substitute for staying physically active with exercise. Even for 
          people who spend lots of time sedentary, if they meet recommended 
          physical activity levels, they have a 30% lower risk for all-cause
          mortality (ACSM, 2018). This not only elucidates the importance of
          physical activity, but it also demonstrates how vital it is to avoid 
          sedentary behaviors. A 30% reduction of risk for all-cause mortality 
          is good, but not great. That is why exercise should be paired with a 
          less sedentary lifestyle to reduce sedentary-related risks as much as
          possible. <b>There are so many benefits of regular physical activity,
          and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (2018) lists some 
          of these out:</b>

        <p class="text-margin">
          One of the best ways to make progress with anything is to set 
          short-term and long-term goals that are specific, measurable, 
          achievable, relevant, and time-specific (SMART). Setting goals 
          like this allows progress to be tracked, and can add satisfaction of 
          completing goals. This can then lead to increased motivation. <b>Use 
          Desk Health's Goal Tracker feature to create your own goals and track

          Writing in a journal can be a fun and relaxing way to think about any
          goals and progress that has been made. It can be a great motivational
          tool to think and write about what you'd like to accomplish, and it
          can boost happiness and well-being to reflect on your 
          accomplishments, or people and things you are grateful for in life. 
          Journaling can be a great self-love tool, self-discovery tool and a 
          way to work on self-improvement. <b>Desk Health's Reflection Journal

          Hydration Log Can Help You Make Sure to Get Enough Water Everyday!

        <p class="text-margin">
          Making sure to stay hydrated is vital for people to feel and look 
          their best. Consuming enough water can improve cognitive performance 
          and mood; decrease risk for delirium; improve gastrointestinal 
          function; protect kidneys and their function; help regulate blood 
          volume, blood pressure, and heart rate; help with orthostatic 
          hypotension; possibly prevent dehydration-related headaches; improve 
          skin thickness, density, offset water loss through skin, and improve 
          skin hydration; and possibly reduce risk for a variety of chronic 
          diseases (Popkin et al., 2011). <b>Use Desk Health's Hydration Log to
          keep track of your water intake to stay healthy!</b>
