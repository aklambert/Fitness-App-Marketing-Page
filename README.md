# Fitness-App-Marketing-Page
This is a practice marketing page for a made-up fitness app, created when I was first learning web development. Initially, this project was created for practice. While building this, I was also brainstorming ideas for a fitness app I wanted to potentially create later. 

I have since created the Android app `Wellness Journal`, (see https://github.com/aklambert/Wellness-Journal) which was inspired by the app being marketed in this project.
